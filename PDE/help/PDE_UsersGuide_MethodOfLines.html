<h3><font color="#008000" size=5>Method of Lines</font></h3>
<p>
The first step in constructing PDE is to drag the <b>WorldModel</b>
block in the diagram. The WorldModel block contains general <br>
information about the problem, such as the number of grid points the
user wish to use to solve the problem. These information are then <br>
"propagated" to all the blocks in the diagram that need them.
The heart of the Method of Lines Package are the integrator and <br>
derivative blocks. Once the user know the problem it is easy to
implement it in Dymola. Typically the problem consists of a <br>
PDE and initial and boundary conditions. The initial condition can
be passed to the <b>IC</b> input of the integrator block. For the <br>
boundary conditions we must additionally specify some parameters in
the <b>WorldModel</b> block: <br><br>

<ul>
<li> <b>bcl</b> and <b>bcr</b> specify whether there is a boundary condition at
     the left and at the right respectively (0: no, 1: yes). <br><br> </li>
<li> <b>vb</b> and <b>ve</b> specify the first and last unknown variable
     respectively. The same applies to <b>icb</b> and <b>ice</b>, which specify the <br>
     first and last variable for which an initial condition must be
     specified.</li>
</ul>

<br>
The information in the second point is redundant and could be
deduced from the first point. However, for better understanding and <br>
use this choice was taken. In the WorldModel block the number
of grid points can be specified in the <b>n</b> parameter. Per <br>
default n = 10. Let now turn our attention to the integrator
block. This block implements PDEs of the form

<p>

</p>

where <b>u</b> is the unknown function and <b>R</b> is the right
part of the equation that can contain space derivatives, constant <br>
values and so on (See Examples). This means that if we do not have
the PDE in this form we must first convert it to this form before <br>
passing it to the integrator. Once this step is achieved we can
build the right part of the equation and at the end pass it to the <br>
<b>R</b> input of the integrator block.
Now say that one of the component of the right part of the equation <br>
is a derivative of unknown function with respect to space. In this
case we can use the derivative blocks that the Package provide. For <br>
example for the first-order space derivative use the <b>u_x</b>
block. It is important to note here that in the case of the boundary <br>
condition of type

<p>

</p>

say at the left part of the domain, we must set the bcl
parameter in the corresponding block to -1 which tells that we are <br>
in front of the symmetry boundary condition at the left part
of the domain. The same applies for the right part of the domain, in <br>
which case we must set the parameter bcr to -1. Another
important point is the accuracy of the derivative computation. For <br>
the computation of the first order space derivative for example, the
second, fourth and sixth order central difference approximations <br>
were provided. The user can choose which one to use by specifying
the value of the <b>u_x</b> parameter in the <b>WorldModel</b> block. <br>
